Prediction of Credit card approval 
This is a college final semester project completed under the guidance of United Network of Professionals(UNP) Team.

About : The Credit Card Approval project aims to predict whether a credit card application will be approved or rejected based on various applicant attributes, such as demographic details (age, gender, etc.), financial history (debt, income, credit score), and categorical factors (marital status, employment, etc.).

The project involves data preprocessing techniques like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. Different machine learning algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, or others, are applied to develop a predictive model. The ultimate goal is to improve the accuracy of predictions and gain insights into which factors most influence the approval decision.
